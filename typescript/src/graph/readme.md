- Q1. Dijkstra's shortest path
  You have been given an undirected graph of ‘V’ vertices (labelled from 0 to V-1) and ‘E’ edges. Each edge connecting two nodes u and v has a weight denoting the distance between them.
  Your task is to find the shortest path distance from the source node (For this problem, it is the node labelled as 0) to all vertices given in the graph.
- Q2. Check If Path Exists
  You are given a directed and unweighted graph of 'V' vertices and 'E' edges. All edges are given in a 2-dimensional array ‘Edges’ in which ‘Edges[i][0]’ and ‘Edges[i][1]’ contain an edge. Your task is to check if there exists a path from the vertex 'source' to 'destination'.
