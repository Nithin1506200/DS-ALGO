- `juspay`: Q1. Encode N-ary tree to binary tree
  You have been given an N-ary tree ‘N’ nodes with node ‘1’ as head of the tree. Encode the above N-ary tree into a binary tree such that if only the encoded binary tree was given to you, you could restore the N-ary tree from the encoded binary tree. You also need to write a function that could decode a given binary tree and return a N-ary tree as in input format.
